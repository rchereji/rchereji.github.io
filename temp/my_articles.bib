	abstract = {The genome is packaged and organized in an ordered, non-random manner and specific chromatin segments contact nuclear substructures to mediate this organization. Transfer RNA genes (tDNAs) are binding sites for transcription factors and architectural proteins and are thought to play an important role in the organization of the genome. In this study, we investigate the role of tDNAs in genomic organization and chromosome function by editing a chromosome so that it lacks any tDNAs. Surprisingly our analyses of this tDNA-less chromosome show that loss of tDNAs does not grossly affect chromatin architecture or chromosome tethering and mobility. However, loss of tDNAs affects local nucleosome positioning and the binding of SMC proteins at these loci. The absence of tDNAs also leads to changes in centromere clustering and a reduction in the frequency of long-range HML-HMR heterochromatin clustering with concomitant effects on gene silencing. We propose that the tDNAs primarily affect local chromatin structure that result in effects on long-range chromosome architecture.},

We have examined the interplay between RSC (a conserved essential SWI/SNF-type complex that determines NDR size) and the ISW1, CHD1, and ISW2 nucleosome spacing enzymes in chromatin organization and transcription, using isogenic strains lacking all combinations of these enzymes. The contributions of  these remodelers to chromatin organization are largely combinatorial, distinct, and nonredundant, supporting a model in which the +1 nucleosome is positioned by  RSC and then used as a reference nucleosome by the spacing enzymes. Defective chromatin organization correlates with altered RNA polymerase II (Pol II) distribution. RSC-depleted cells exhibit low levels of elongating Pol II and high levels of terminating Pol II, consistent with defects in both termination and initiation, suggesting that RSC facilitates both. Cells lacking both ISW1 and CHD1 show the opposite Pol II distribution, suggesting elongation and termination defects. These cells have extremely disrupted chromatin, with high levels of closely packed dinucleosomes involving the second (+2) nucleosome. We propose that ISW1 and CHD1 facilitate Pol II elongation by separating closely packed nucleosomes.},

Each nucleosome, the fundamental unit of chromatin, has 147 base pairs (bp) of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer (Richmond and Davey in Nature 423:145, 2003). In order to describe how chromatin fiber formation affects nucleosome positioning and energetics, we have developed a thermodynamic model of finite-size particles with effective nearest-neighbor interactions and arbitrary DNA-binding energies. We show that both one- and two-body interactions can be extracted from one-particle density profiles based on high-throughput maps of in vitro or in vivo nucleosome positions. Although a simpler approach that neglects two-body interactions (even if they are in fact present in the system) can be used to predict sequence determinants of nucleosome positions, the full theory is required to disentangle one- and two-body effects. Finally, we construct a minimal model in which nucleosomes are positioned primarily by steric exclusion and two-body interactions rather than intrinsic histone-DNA sequence preferences. The model reproduces nucleosome occupancy patterns observed over transcribed regions in living cells.},

Chromatin structure formation leads to 10−11 base pair (bp) discretization of linker lengths caused by the smaller free energy cost of packaging nucleosomes into regular chromatin fibers if their rotational setting (defined by the DNA helical twist) is conserved. We describe nucleosome positions along the fiber using a thermodynamic model of finite-size particles with both intrinsic histone-DNA interactions and an effective two-body potential. We infer one- and two-body energies directly from high-throughput maps of nucleosome positions.

	abstract = {All cells perceive and respond to environmental stresses through elaborate stress-sensing networks. Yeast cells sense stress through diverse signaling pathways that converge on the transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4, which respond by initiating rapid, idiosyncratic cycles into and out of the nucleus. To understand the role of Msn2/4 nuclear localization dynamics, we combined time-lapse studies of Msn2-GFP localization in living cells with computational modeling of stress-sensing signaling networks. We find that several signaling pathways, including Ras/protein kinase A, AMP-activated kinase, the high-osmolarity response mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and protein phosphatase 1, regulate activation of Msn2 in distinct ways in response to different stresses. Moreover, we find that bursts of nuclear localization elicit a more robust transcriptional response than does sustained nuclear localization. Using stochastic modeling, we reproduce in silico the responses of Msn2 to different stresses, and demonstrate that bursts of localization arise from noise in the signaling pathways amplified by the small number of Msn2 molecules in the cell. This noise imparts diverse behaviors to genetically identical cells, allowing cell populations to “hedge their bets” in responding to an uncertain future, and to balance growth and survival in an unpredictable environment.},

	abstract = {RSC and SWI/SNF are related ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling machines that move nucleosomes, regulating access to DNA. We addressed their roles in nucleosome phasing relative to transcription start sites in yeast. SWI/SNF has no effect on phasing at the global level. In contrast, RSC depletion results in global nucleosome repositioning: Both upstream and downstream nucleosomal arrays shift toward the nucleosome-depleted region (NDR), with no change in spacing, resulting in a narrower and partly filled NDR. The global picture of RSC-depleted chromatin represents the average of a range of chromatin structures, with most genes showing a shift of the +1 or the −1 nucleosome into the NDR. Using RSC ChIP data reported by others, we show that RSC occupancy is highest on the coding regions of heavily transcribed genes, though not at their NDRs. We propose that RSC has a role in restoring chromatin structure after transcription. Analysis of gene pairs in different orientations demonstrates that phasing patterns reflect competition between phasing signals emanating from neighboring NDRs. These signals may be in phase, resulting in constructive interference and a regular array, or out of phase, resulting in destructive interference and fuzzy positioning. We propose a modified barrier model, in which a stable complex located at the NDR acts as a bidirectional phasing barrier. In RSC-depleted cells, this barrier has a smaller footprint, resulting in narrower NDRs. Thus, RSC plays a critical role in organizing yeast chromatin.},

Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) is commonly used to map nucleosomes genome-wide, but nucleosome maps are affected by the degree of digestion. It has been proposed that many yeast promoters are not nucleosome-free but instead occupied by easily digested, unstable, “fragile” nucleosomes. We analyzed the histone content of all MNase-sensitive complexes by MNase-ChIP-seq and sonication-ChIP-seq. We find that yeast promoters are predominantly bound by non-histone protein complexes, with little evidence for fragile nucleosomes. We do detect MNase-sensitive nucleosomes elsewhere in the genome, including at transcription termination sites. However, they have high A/T content, suggesting that MNase sensitivity does not indicate instability, but rather the preference of MNase for A/T-rich DNA, such that A/T-rich nucleosomes are digested faster than G/C-rich nucleosomes. We confirm our observations by analyzing ChIP-exo, chemical mapping, and ATAC-seq data from other laboratories. Thus, histone ChIP-seq experiments are essential to distinguish nucleosomes from other DNA-binding proteins that protect against MNase.},

The mechanisms determining nucleosome positioning are therefore of paramount importance for understanding gene regulation and other events that occur in chromatin, such as transcription, replication, and repair. Here, we review our current understanding of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning: DNA sequence, nonhistone DNA-binding proteins, chromatin-remodeling enzymes, and transcription. We outline the major challenges for the future: elucidating the precise mechanisms of chromatin opening and promoter activation, identifying the complexes that occupy promoters, and understanding the multiscale problem of chromatin fiber organization.},

By comparing nucleosome dyad positioning maps to existing genomic and transcriptomic data, we evaluated the contributions of sequence, transcription, and histones H1 and H2A.Z in defining the chromatin landscape. We present a biophysical model that neglects DNA sequence and shows that steric occlusion suffices to explain the salient features of nucleosome positioning.},

It is unknown how the dynamic binding of transcription factors (TFs) is molecularly linked to chromatin remodeling and transcription. Using single-molecule tracking (SMT), we show that the chromatin remodeler RSC speeds up the search process of the TF Ace1p for its response elements (REs) at the CUP1 promoter. We quantified smFISH mRNA data using a gene bursting model and demonstrated that RSC regulates transcription bursts of CUP1 only by modulating TF occupancy but does not affect initiation and elongation rates. We show by SMT that RSC binds to activated promoters transiently, and based on MNase-seq data, that RSC does not affect the nucleosomal occupancy at CUP1. Therefore, transient binding of Ace1p and rapid bursts of transcription at CUP1 may be dependent on short repetitive cycles of nucleosome mobilization. This type of regulation reduces the transcriptional noise and ensures a homogeneous response of the cell population to heavy metal stress.},

Here, we investigated the involvement of SPT6 in type I interferon (IFN)-induced transcription in murine fibroblasts. In RNA-seq analysis, Spt6 siRNA attenuates about half of 200 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), while not affecting housekeeping genes. ISGs with high mRNA induction are more susceptible to Spt6 siRNA than those with lower levels of induction. ChIP analysis shows that SPT6 is recruited to highly inducible, Spt6 siRNA-sensitive ISGs, but not to other siRNA-insensitive ISGs. Furthermore, SPT6 recruitment is abrogated in cells lacking the histone methyltransferase NSD2. In co-IP experiments, SPT6 interacts with NSD2. In summary, SPT6 facilitates IFN-induced transcription, highlighting its critical role in gene activation.},

	abstract = {The nucleosome remodeling complex RSC functions throughout the yeast genome to set the positions of −1 and +1 nucleosomes and thereby determines the widths of nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs). The related complex SWI/SNF participates in nucleosome remodeling/eviction and promoter activation at certain yeast genes, including those activated by transcription factor Gcn4, but did not appear to function broadly in establishing NDRs. By analyzing the large cohort of Gcn4-induced genes in mutants lacking the catalytic subunits of SWI/SNF or RSC, we uncovered cooperation between these remodelers in evicting nucleosomes from different locations in the promoter and repositioning the +1 nucleosome downstream to produce wider NDRs—highly depleted of nucleosomes—during transcriptional activation. SWI/SNF also functions on a par with RSC at the most highly transcribed constitutively expressed genes, suggesting general cooperation by these remodelers for maximal transcription. SWI/SNF and RSC occupancies are greatest at the most highly expressed genes, consistent with their cooperative functions in nucleosome remodeling and transcriptional activation. Thus, SWI/SNF acts comparably with RSC in forming wide nucleosome-free NDRs to achieve high-level transcription but only at the most highly expressed genes exhibiting the greatest SWI/SNF occupancies.},

	abstract = {Summary
Gcn4 is a yeast transcriptional activator induced by amino acid starvation. ChIP-seq analysis revealed 546 genomic sites occupied by Gcn4 in starved cells, representing ∼30\% of Gcn4-binding motifs. Surprisingly, only ∼40\% of the bound sites are in promoters, of which only ∼60\% activate transcription, indicating extensive negative control over Gcn4 function. Most of the remaining ∼300 Gcn4-bound sites are within coding sequences (CDSs), with ∼75 representing the only bound sites near Gcn4-induced genes. Many such unconventional sites map between divergent antisense and sub-genic sense transcripts induced within CDSs adjacent to induced TBP peaks, consistent with Gcn4 activation of cryptic bidirectional internal promoters. Mutational analysis confirms that Gcn4 sites within CDSs can activate sub-genic and full-length transcripts from the same or adjacent genes, showing that functional Gcn4 binding is not confined to promoters. Our results show that internal promoters can be regulated by an activator that functions at conventional 5′-positioned promoters.},
